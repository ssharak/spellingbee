# spellingbee

Just a quick program I threw together in a day (expect plenty of rough edges) to help my kids practice their spelling bee words.
Takes words randomly from text files in the same directory by grade level (e.g. 3.txt or 8.txt), speaks them out using gTTS (locally), then waits for the user to enter the correct spelling. Once all the words in the list are done, it starts the list again.
